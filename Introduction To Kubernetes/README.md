# Introduction to Kubernetes - Basic Concept

Kubernetes is a basic building block of the modern application development that is based on DevOps and Cloud-Native Architecture. Moving from a traditional 'Monolithic' application development into a microservices application development utilizing containers technology is becoming the norm and has been for a while. However, when the number of containers that are hosting your application grow in number to 100's or 1000's or even more, then managing, orchestrating, and automating these containers and their operation tasks is going to be road blocker. This is where Kubernetes comes in the picture.
